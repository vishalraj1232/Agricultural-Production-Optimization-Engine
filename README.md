# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine
Due to adverse climate condition/upredictable climate changes, farmers are not able to utilise the agricultural land fully and lead to low harvesting.
## Problem Statement: Build a predictive Model so as to suggest the most suitable Crops to grow based on the available Climate and Soil conditions.

Goal: Achieve precision farmimg by optimizing the agricultural production.

Benefits:
1) Optimize productivity
2) Understanding the requirements of climate and soil conditions for crops.
3) Helps to cope up with weather unpredictability
